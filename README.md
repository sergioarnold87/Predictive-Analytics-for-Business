# Predictive-Analytics-for-Business
The Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree program is designed to teach learners to master a scientific approach to solving problems with data and apply predictive analytics and business intelligence to solve real-world problems. 



# Problem Solving with Analytics Nanodegree Projects
Welcome to my repository of projects from Udacity's "Problem Solving with Analytics" Nanodegree. Here you'll find a compilation of projects I've completed during the program, each focusing on different areas of data analysis and problem-solving using analytical tools.

## Project 1: Predicting Catalog Demand
- **Description:** In this project, I used data analysis techniques and linear regression to predict catalog demand for a retail company.
- **Link to Project:** [Predicting Catalog Demand](Link to Project 1 repository)
- **Keynotes:** Learned how to clean and prepare data, build regression models, and make demand forecasts.

## Project 2: Create an Analytical Dataset
- **Description:** In this project, I performed data cleaning, formatting, and merging of various data sources to create an analytical dataset.
- **Link to Project:** [Create an Analytical Dataset](Link to Project 2 repository)
- **Keynotes:** Gained experience in data wrangling, data formatting, and data integration techniques.

## Project 3: Predicting Default Risk
- **Description:** In this project, I applied classification models to predict loan default risk.
- **Link to Project:** [Predicting Default Risk](Link to Project 3 repository)
- **Keynotes:** Learned how to build classification models, evaluate model performance, and assess credit risk.

## Project 4: A/B Test a New Menu Launch
- **Description:** In this project, I conducted an A/B analysis to assess the impact of a new menu launch in a restaurant chain.
- **Link to Project:** [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](Link to Project 4 repository)
- **Keynotes:** Gained skills in A/B testing, statistical analysis, and drawing actionable insights from experiments.

## Project 5: Combining Predictive Techniques
